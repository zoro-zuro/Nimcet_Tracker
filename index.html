This file has been moved to the original migration backup. The current project is now a Next.js application.

For reference, the original single-file HTML application can be found in the git history or by checking out the original commit.

The new Next.js + Convex foundation includes:
- Next.js 15 with App Router
- TypeScript support
- Tailwind CSS
- Convex backend schema and functions
- Health check UI to verify the stack works

To run the new application:
```bash
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```
